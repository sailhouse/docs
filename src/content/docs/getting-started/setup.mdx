## Creating an account

First things first, [get signed in](https://app.sailhouse.dev) and create a team.

Then, install the CLI.
```bash
brew install sailhouse
```

And connect to your fresh-faced, lovely, new account.
```bash
sailhouse auth
```

## Creating an app

In Sailhouse, apps are the logical separator for your topics. This could be environments, projects, apps, whatever.

```bash
sailhouse apps create [slug]
```

Oh yeah, we do everything with slugs too.
