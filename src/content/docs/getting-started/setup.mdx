title: Setup
---

## Creating an account

First things first, [get signed in](https://app.sailhouse.dev) and create a team.

Then, install the CLI.
```bash
brew install sailhouse
```

And connect to your fresh-faced, lovely, new account.
```bash
sailhouse auth
```

## Creating an app

In Sailhouse, apps are the logical separator for your topics. This could be environments, projects, apps, whatever.

```bash
sailhouse apps create [slug]
```

Oh yeah, we do everything with slugs too.

## Get sending events

We have a few language-native SDKs/clients available

- [GoLang](https://github.com/sailhouse/sdk-go)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/sailhouse/sdk-ts)

### Creating a token

With your CLI authenticated, you can create a token easily

```bash
sailhouse tokens create
```

Then, taking the `sh_app_` prefixed value, you can store that in an environment variable on the platform you're running in.

### Using the Go SDK

```go
import sailhouse "github.com/sailhouse/sdk-go"

func main() {
    client := sailhouse.NewClient(os.Getenv("SAILHOUSE_TOKEN"))
}
```
