title: Setup
---

## Creating an account

First things first, [get signed in](https://app.sailhouse.dev) and create a team.

Then, install the CLI.
```bash
brew install sailhouse/tap/sailhouse
```

And connect to your fresh-faced, lovely, new account.
```bash
sailhouse auth
```

## Creating an app

In Sailhouse, apps are the logical separator for your topics. This could be environments, projects, apps, whatever.

```bash
sailhouse apps create [slug]
```

Oh yeah, we do everything with slugs too.

## Get sending events

We have a few language-native SDKs/clients available

- [GoLang](https://github.com/sailhouse/sdk-go)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/sailhouse/sdk-ts)

### Creating a token

With your CLI authenticated, you can create a token easily

```bash
sailhouse tokens create
```

Then, taking the `sh_app_` prefixed value, you can store that in an environment variable on the platform you're running in.

### Using the Go SDK

Below is an example for utilising the Go SDK on a [Netlify Function](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/create/?fn-language=go#create-function-file-3)

```go
package main

import (
	"os"

	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/events"
	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda"
	"github.com/sailhouse/sdk-go/sailhouse"
)

func handler(request events.APIGatewayProxyRequest) (*events.APIGatewayProxyResponse, error) {
	client := sailhouse.NewSailhouseClient(os.Getenv("SAILHOUSE_TOKEN"))

	client.Publish("awesome-example", map[string]string{
		"message": "Hello World!",
	})

	return &events.APIGatewayProxyResponse{
		StatusCode: 200,
		Body:       "Hello World!",
	}, nil
}

func main() {
	lambda.Start(handler)
}

```

### Using the TypeScript SDK

Below is another example of using the TypeScript SDK within a Netlify Function.

```ts
import { Handler } from "@netlify/functions";
import { SailhouseClient } from "@sailhouse/client";

export const handler: Handler = async (event, _) => {
  const { body } = event;
  const { email, type } = JSON.parse(body ?? "{}");

  const client = new SailhouseClient(process.env.SAILHOUSE_API_KEY!);

  await client.publish("signups", {
    email,
    type,
  });

  return {
    statusCode: 200,
  };
};
```
