title: Tokens
---

Tokens are the key to your code calling the platform. They're in the format of `sh_app_<token>`, and are scoped to a given application on Sailhouse.

## Generating tokens

Tokens are easily generated from the CLI.

```sh
sailhouse tokens create
```

## List generated tokens

```sh
sailhouse tokens list
```
