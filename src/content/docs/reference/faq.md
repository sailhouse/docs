Okay, they haven't really been asked, but we've got to follow the format.

## Why use Sailhouse over Kakfa, GCP Pub/Sub, Azure Service Bus etc.?

Simple answer - simplicity.

Sailhouse is built to make event-driven applications easy. Built out of a frustration for using event systems at scale, it's designed to solve the problems you run into and get out of your way for the rest.

From the CLI to the SDKs, it's all about taking idea -> concept -> launch as quickly as possible.

## Can I see the data in events?

Yes!

This was a must for the early versions of the platform. Can be done both on the App and CLI.

## Where is the data located?

London, UK for the Beta.

## Is it on the edge?

Sailhouse is currently hosted in Virginia and London, as time progresses more locations will be added based on usage.

## Is data encrypted?

Yes, in transit and at rest.
