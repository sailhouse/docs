title: Astro
---

[Astro](https://astro.build) is a popular web framework for generating static, server or even hybrid-rendered sites and applications.

Sailhouse can be leveraged in [server endpoints](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/endpoints/#server-endpoints-api-routes), and even directly on pages themselves, via the `@sailhouse/client` package for JavaScript and TypeScript.

## Basic usage

:::note[Watch out!]
Astro must have [SSR mode enabled](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/#enabling-ssr-in-your-project) for this to work!
:::

### Server endpoints (API Routes)

Astro's [Server Endpoints](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/endpoints/#server-endpoints-api-routes) serve as the base for defining a traditional `POST`, `PUT` etc. API handler.

You can utilise the Sailhouse client to handle anything from JSON all the way to form data.

```js
const client = new SailhouseClient(import.meta.env.SAILHOUSE_TOKEN);

export const POST: APIRoute = async ({ request, redirect }) => {
    const data = await request.formData();

    await client.publish("email-submitted", {
      email: data.get("email"),
    });

    return redirect('/thanks')
}
```

### Page SSR

Server Side Rendered pages on Astro execute the JavaScript/TypeScript included in the Frontmatter `---` section at the top of a `.astro` page.

This includes access to a `Request` object via `Astro.request`, allowing you to read in any `POST` data sent to the page (via a form submission etc.)

```astro
---
import { SailhouseClient } from "@sailhouse/client";

let submitted = false;
if (Astro.request.method === "POST") {
  const data = await Astro.request.formData();

  const client = new SailhouseClient(import.meta.env.SAILHOUSE_TOKEN);
  await client.publish("email-submitted", {
    email: data.get("email"),
  });

  submitted = true;
}
---

<div>
  {submitted && <div style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}>Thanks for submitting!</div>}
  <form method="post">
    <input type="email" name="email" />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</div>
```

## Middleware

Astro also includes a very flexible [middleware](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/middleware/) API for mutating all requests as they come in before being sent to the specific pages or API routes.

The Sailhouse client can be injected via middleware to make it even easier to utilise across your whole application.

:::note
This section assumes you're familiar with configuring middleware on Astro. If not, some subject matter may appear to be missing context.

:::

### Setting up env.d.ts - TypeScript only

If you're utilising TypeScript, you'll want to configure the `src/env.d.ts` file to include the `SailhouseClient` type on the request types.

```ts
/// <reference types="astro/client" />

declare namespace App {
     interface Locals {
        client: import('@sailhouse/client').SailhouseClient
     }
}
```

### Injecting the client

To inject the client, we first need to create `src/middelware.ts` (or `.js` if you'd like) if it does exist already.

Below is an example focused on _just_ Sailhouse.

```ts
import { SailhouseClient } from "@sailhouse/client";
import { defineMiddleware } from "astro:middleware";

export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(async ({locals}, next) => {
    const client = new SailhouseClient(import.meta.env.SAILHOUSE_TOKEN);

    locals.client = client;

    await next();
})
```

### Using the client

Now, on every server-side request, Sailhouse is accessible via the `locals` property.


#### Server Endpoints

For server endpoints, notice the destructuring of `locals` to retrieve `client` in the route arguments.

```ts
import type { APIRoute } from "astro";

export const POST: APIRoute = async ({ request, redirect, locals: { client }}) => {
    const data = await request.formData();

    await client.publish("email-submitted", {
      email: data.get("email"),
    });

    return redirect('/thanks')
}
```

#### Page SSR

For server-rendered pages, notice the reference to `Astro.locals.client` instead of a freshly instantiated `SailhouseClient` as above.

```astro
---
let submitted = false;
if (Astro.request.method === "POST") {
  const data = await Astro.request.formData();

  await Astro.locals.client.publish("email-submitted", {
    email: data.get("email"),
  });

  submitted = true;
}
---

<div>
  {submitted && <div style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}>Thanks for submitting!</div>}
  <form method="post">
    <input type="email" name="email" />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</div>
```
