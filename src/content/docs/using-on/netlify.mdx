Netlify has [Netlify Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/) which allow you to write what are essentially lambda functions trivially in the same code-base as your frontend application.

### Configuring the token

Given we're [authenticated with the CLI](/reference/cli#Authenticating), we can easily set the Netlify environment variable from the command line.

```bash
netlify env:set SAILHOUSE_TOKEN=$(sailhouse tokens create --app <app-slug>)
```

You could do this instead on the Netlify Dashboard, and you can read more about environment variables in the [Netlify docs](https://docs.netlify.com/environment-variables/overview/)

### Examples

Below are some basic examples to get you started.


### Using the Go SDK

Below is an example for utilising the Go SDK on a [Netlify Function](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/create/?fn-language=go#create-function-file-3)

```go
package main

import (
	"os"

	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/events"
	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda"
	"github.com/sailhouse/sdk-go/sailhouse"
)

func handler(request events.APIGatewayProxyRequest) (*events.APIGatewayProxyResponse, error) {
	client := sailhouse.NewSailhouseClient(os.Getenv("SAILHOUSE_TOKEN"))

	client.Publish("awesome-example", map[string]string{
		"message": "Hello World!",
	})

	return &events.APIGatewayProxyResponse{
		StatusCode: 200,
		Body:       "Hello World!",
	}, nil
}

func main() {
	lambda.Start(handler)
}

```

### Using the TypeScript SDK

Below is another example of using the TypeScript SDK within a Netlify Function.

```ts
import { Handler } from "@netlify/functions";
import { SailhouseClient } from "@sailhouse/client";

export const handler: Handler = async (event, _) => {
  const { body } = event;
  const { email, type } = JSON.parse(body ?? "{}");

  const client = new SailhouseClient(process.env.SAILHOUSE_API_KEY!);

  await client.publish("signups", {
    email,
    type,
  });

  return {
    statusCode: 200,
  };
};
```
