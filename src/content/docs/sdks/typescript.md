## Installing

The TypeScript SDK can be installed via your _favourite_ package manager, e.g. `pnpm`

```sh
pnpm add @sailhouse/client
```

## Basic Usage

### Importing and initialising

The `SailhouseClient` class from the package has everything we need to get started.

Provided you have generated a [token](/reference/tokens), you can create a client from the class.

```typescript
import { SailhouseClient } from '@sailhouse/client';

const client = new SailhouseClient(process.env.SAILHOUSE_TOKEN);

// lets go ðŸŽ‰
```


### Sending an event

The client has an async `publish` method for sending data to a given topic.

```ts
await client.publish("some-topic", {
    text: "example contents",
    obj: {
        key: "value",
    },
});
```

The second argument can be any object. Ideally, this should just be a map, as the contents are stringified via `JSON.stringify(...)` and we don't want that to get messy.

### Recieving events from a pull subscription

The client has a `getEvents` method for pull subscriptions.


```ts
const { events } = await client.getEvents<Message>(
    "awesome-example",
    "awesome-pull"
);

await Promise.all(events.map(async (event) => {
// Do something with the event ðŸ¤”

await event.ack();
}));
```
